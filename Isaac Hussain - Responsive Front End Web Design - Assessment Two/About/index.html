        <div class="v3_64"></div><p class="v3_65">We live in a busy and never-resting world. Be it due to events that
            have happened in the past, or our anxieties and aspirations, it’s hard to remind ourselves to enjoy our
            present experience.

            Here at Mindful, we aim to bring peace in to people’s lives, by teaching and practicing the principles of
            living in the present moment.

            We offer online meditation and yoga courses, which we guarantee will cultivate consciousness in both mind
            and body. Our meditation sessions will help you realise your potential to focus, while our yoga practices
            will develop your body awareness and physical capabilities.

            We also host seasonal retreats that happen all over the world. They are fantastic opportunities to meet and
            practice with members of the community, and gain insights in-person from legendary spiritual
            teachers.</p>
